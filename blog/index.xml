Perhaps surprisingly, different languages take different approaches to this question, for example:</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Cycle Detection for Lock Ordering</title><link>https://whileydave.com/2020/12/19/dynamic-cycle-detection-for-lock-ordering/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/2020/12/19/dynamic-cycle-detection-for-lock-ordering/</guid><description>Recently, I discovered that an algorithm of mine from a few years back is being used in both TensorFlow and the Abseil C++ library (see here and here). That is of course pretty exciting since they are both widely used libraries!</description></item><item><title>Automated Testing for Whiley</title><link>https://whileydave.com/2020/12/02/automated-testing-for-whiley/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/2020/12/02/automated-testing-for-whiley/</guid><description>Recently, the online editor for Whiley was updated with some new features.

One example which doesn&amp;rsquo;t get much attention is partial moves.</description></item><item><title>The Semantics of Semantic Versioning?</title><link>https://whileydave.com/2020/09/24/the-semantics-of-semantic-versioning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/2020/09/24/the-semantics-of-semantic-versioning/</guid><description>Semantic versioning is a surprisingly interesting topic when you get into it.
