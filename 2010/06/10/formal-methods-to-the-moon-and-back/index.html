2010</div><hr><p>I recently came across a rather interesting presentation by <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_J._Holzmann>Gerard Holzmann</a> (author of the <a href=http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html>SPIN</a> model checker) who&rsquo;s currently working for <a href=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/>NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Lab</a>, and previously worked at <a href=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/BellLabs>Bell Labs</a>:</p><p><a href=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Scrub-Spin>http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Scrub-Spin</a></p><p>One of the things he talks about his is a possible moon-landing in 2019, and the software required compared with that of the original landings in 1969. Back then, they ran around 10K of code on a machine with 36K ROM, 2K RAM with a 43KHz CPU. In contrast, they&rsquo;re speculating that the 2019 mission will need 10M lines of code, running on a machine with 1GB RAM and a 1GHz clock cycle. The difference between them seems somewhat expected, I suppose. But, I rather like the point he makes about it: that the moon hasn&rsquo;t changed mass, or orbit, etc; that the physics required to land on the moon is the same; so, why do we need so much more?</p><p>Speaking of the moon landings, you can now get audio and video for them from the NASA site <a href=http://history.nasa.gov/40thann/videos.htm>here</a>, and a transcript of the first landing <a href=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html>here</a>. The bit I really like from the transcript is:</p><blockquote><p>102:38:21 Armstrong: Sure do. Houston, you&rsquo;re looking at our Delta-H.</p><p>102:38:25 Duke: That&rsquo;s affirmative.</p><p>[They have switched to a data readout which shows Houston the difference between their altitude as determined by the radar and the inertial estimate provided by the PGNS.]</p><p>102:38:26 Armstrong: (With the slightest touch of urgency) Program Alarm.</p><p>102:38:28 Duke: It&rsquo;s looking good to us. Over.</p><p>102:38:30 Armstrong: (To Houston) It&rsquo;s a 1202.</p><p>102:38:32 Aldrin: 1202. (Pause)</p><p>[Altitude 33,500 feet. In the 16mm film record, the lunar surface can be seen in the very bottom of Buzz&rsquo;s window. As indicated in Figure 5-5 in the Mission Report, the LM is pitched back about 77 degrees at this time but will start coming noticeably more upright between now and P64.]</p><p>102:38:42 Armstrong (on-board): (To Buzz) What is it? Let&rsquo;s incorporate (the landing radar data). (To Houston) Give us a reading on the 1202 Program Alarm.</p><p>[The 1202 program alarm is being produced by data overflow in the computer. It is not an alarm that they had seen during simulations but, as Neil explained during a post-flight press conference &ldquo;In simulations we have a large number of failures and we are usually spring-loaded to the abort position. And in this case in the real flight, we are spring-loaded to the land position.&rdquo;]</p></blockquote><p>It seems amazing that this could have happened at such a critical moment, given how much money and time had been invested in this project. Well, actually, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that amazing given what we know about software &mldr; it&rsquo;s just another notch on the rather long list of near-software-disasters. I guess the real question is: <em>what are they doing to prevent this from happening next time?</em> Gerrard talks about this issue at length, and he argues that things certainly have improved&mldr;</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It seems that the<a href="http://www.electronics-eetimes.com/en/lunar-lander-project-relies-on-spark-programming-language.html?cmp_id=7&news_id=222902326&vID=296"> SPARK programming language is going to be involved in the lunar lander project</a>, which is definitely a step in the right direction!</p><hr></div></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(function(e,t,n,s,o,i,a){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=o,e[o]=e[o]||function(){(e[o].q=e[o].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[o].l=1*new Date,i=t.createElement(n),a=t.getElementsByTagName(n)[0],i.async=1,i.src=s,a.parentNode.insertBefore(i,a)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-5582165-7","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script></body></html>
