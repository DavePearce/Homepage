(Wellington, NZ) in 2004, I&rsquo;m now enjoying life in New Zealand! At
Imperial College, I was a PhD student in the department of
Computing. My thesis topic was on pointer analysis, although this
lead me in some interesting and alternative directions. Pointer
analysis is the problem of determining what the pointer variables in
a program may point to without running it. Thus, it is a form of
static analysis and an increasingly important component of compilers
and program understanding tools.</p><p>My current research interests focus around the issues of improving
software quality. In particular, using advanced compiler technologies
to automatically find errors in programs. Finally, my other interests
include: programming language design, Tutte polynomials and graph
algorithms.</p><p>My CV is available in PDF and my email address is <a href=mailto:david.pearce@ecs.vuw.ac.nz>david.pearce@ecs.vuw.ac.nz</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
