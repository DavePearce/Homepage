Added support for the --split-edges option.

Incorporated the vorder push heuristic suggested by Michael Monagan. As part of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve added the ability to sort the vertex order according to a depth-first or breadth-first search.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.9.15</title><link>https://whileydave.com/downloads/tuttev0.9.15/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/downloads/tuttev0.9.15/</guid><description>The following updates have been made:
For the --chromatic option, the tool now automatically removes multi-edges on the input graph.

Added better support for report statistical data on the operation of the cache. This is to help diagnosing cache behaviour, as there&amp;rsquo;s some interesting possibilities for optimising the caching strategies.</description></item><item><title>Computing Tutte Polynomials</title><link>https://whileydave.com/publications/hpr10_toms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/publications/hpr10_toms/</guid><description>Abstract: The Tutte polynomial of a graph is a 2-variable polynomial graph invariant of considerable importance in both combinatorics and statistical physics.

Tutte polynomials play an important role in graph theory, combinatorics, matroid theory, knot theory, and experimental physics. For example, the polynomials can be evaluated to find the number of spanning trees in a graph, the number of forests in a graph, the number of connected spanning subgraphs, the number of spanning subgraphs, and the number of acyclic orientations.</description></item></channel></rss>
