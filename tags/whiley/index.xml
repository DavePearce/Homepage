This thesis develops a compiler to convert a program written in the verification friendly programming language Whiley into an efficient implementation in C. Our compiler uses a mixture of static analysis, run-time monitoring and a code generator to and faster integer types, eliminate unnecessary array copies and de-allocate unused memory without garbage collection, so that Whiley programs can be translated into C code to run fast and for long periods on general operating systems as well as limited-resource embedded devices.</description></item><item><title>On the Architecture of a (Verifying) Compiler</title><link/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>An Introduction to Software Verification with Whiley</title><link>https://whileydave.com/publications/pug18_etss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/publications/pug18_etss/</guid><description>Abstract: This tutorial introduces the basic ideas of software specification and verification, which are important techniques for assuring the quality of software and eliminating common kinds of errors such as buffer overflow.</description></item><item><title>Inferring invariants from postconditions in Whiley</title><link>https://whileydave.com/publications/pope18_engr489/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/publications/pope18_engr489/</guid><description>Abstract.

This project investigates improving the performance of Whiley programs by executing portions of these programs on GPUs while maintaining as closely as possible the semantics of the language.

Introducing concurrent behaviour into a program tends to also introduce unpredictable behaviour. The actor model is an attempt to simplify concurrency and reduce such problems. The Whiley programming language is structured around concurrent processes, which are analogous to actors, but it runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine, which does not provide support for the model.</description></item><item><title>Short Demonstration of The Whiley Programming Language</title><link/><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Whiley</title><link>https://whileydave.com/projects/whiley/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/projects/whiley/</guid><description>Whiley is a hybrid imperative and functional programming language which has been under development since 2009.
