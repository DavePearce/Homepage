Several impressive systems have been developed to this end, such as ESC/Java and Spec#, which build on existing programming languages (e.g., Java, C#). We have been developing a programming language from scratch to simplify verification, called Whiley, and an accompanying verifying compiler. In this paper, we present a technical overview of the verifying compiler and document the numerous design decisions made. Indeed, many of our decisions reflect those of similar tools. However, they have often been ignored in the literature and/or spread thinly throughout. In doing this, we hope to provide a useful resource for those building verifying compilers.</p></div></div></body></html>
