Recent advances in automated theorem proving have given rise to a range of new verification tools being developed. Despite this, very little is known about the effect of using such tools on software development. In this paper, we present several verification-related usability hypotheses which we believe warrant further investigation. These hypotheses are based on observations from the literature, as well as our own experiences in developing and using the Whiley verification system.</p></div></div></body></html>
