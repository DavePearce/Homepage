His original algorithm required at most <code>v(2 + 5w)</code> bits of storage, where w is the machine’s word size, whilst Nuutila and Soisalon-Soininen reduced this to <code>v(1 + 4w)</code>. Many real world applications routinely operate on very large graphs where the storage requirements of such algorithms is a concern. We present a novel improvement on Tarjan’s algorithm which reduces the space requirements to <code>v(1 + 3w)</code> bits in the worst case. Furthermore, our algorithm has been independently integrated into the widely-used SciPy library for scientific computing.</p><p><strong>Notes.</strong> A straightforward implementation of the algorithm is available <a href=http://github.com/DavePearce/StronglyConnectedComponents>here</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
