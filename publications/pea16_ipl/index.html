His original algorithm required at most <code>v(2 + 5w)</code> bits of storage, where w is the machine’s word size, whilst Nuutila and Soisalon-Soininen reduced this to <code>v(1 + 4w)</code>. Many real world applications routinely operate on very large graphs where the storage requirements of such algorithms is a concern. We present a novel improvement on Tarjan’s algorithm which reduces the space requirements to <code>v(1 + 3w)</code> bits in the worst case. Furthermore, our algorithm has been independently integrated into the widely-used SciPy library for scientific computing.</p><p><strong>Notes.</strong> This algorithm was incorporated into <a href=https://www.scipy.org/>SciPy</a>, a widely used Python Library for scientific computing (see <a href=https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csgraph.connected_components.html>here</a>). Some discussion of the SciPy implementation can be found <a href=http://www.timl.id.au/SCC/>here</a> as well. A straightforward Java implementation of the algorithm is available <a href=http://github.com/DavePearce/StronglyConnectedComponents>here</a> and another C++ implementation is available <a href=https://github.com/edervishaj/strongly-connected-components>here</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
