The analysis is formulated as a graph of set constraints and solved using a worklist algorithm. Indirections lead to new constraints being added during this process.
In this work, we present a new algorithm for online cycle detection, and a difference propagation technique which records changes in a variable’s solution. Effectiveness of these and other methods are evaluated experimentally using nine common ‘C’ programs ranging between 1000 to 55000 lines of code.</p></div></div></body></html>
