Object querying is an abstraction of operations over collections, including operations that combine multiple collections, which would otherwise have to be manually implemented. Such manual implementations are ‘low-level’; they force developers to specify how an operation is done, rather than what the operation to do is. Many operations over collections can easily be expressed as queries. JQL provides a Java-like syntax for expressing these queries, an optimizing query evaluator that can dynamically reconfigure query evaluation, and a caching system that allows querying to replace common collection operations with incrementally cached versions.</p></div></div></body></html>
