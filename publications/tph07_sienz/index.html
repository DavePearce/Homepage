It also provides a normalised representation that can be used as an equivalence relation on graphs and has applications in diverse areas such micro-biology and physics. A highly efficient algorithm for computing Tutte polynomials has been elsewhere developed by Haggard and Pearce. This relies on various optimisations and heuristics to improve performance; however, understanding the effect of a particular heuristic remains challenging, since the computation trees involved are very large. Therefore, we have constructed a visualisation of the computation in order to study the effect of various heuristics on the algorithmsâ€™ operation.</p></div></div></body></html>
