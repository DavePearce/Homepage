28th,
2012</div><hr><p>Recently, I was having a somewhat heated discussion with a friend about the Java I/O library (specificially <code>java.io.*</code>).  His position was that the library is unnecessarily cluttered and verbose, and that  I/O in C is much simpler and more productive.  Whilst I agreed with some of that, I also argued that the Java I/O library is powerful and more flexible than C.  Here are some of the main points we covered:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Abstracting stream encodings away from stream processing</strong>.  The ability for objects in Java to delegate to an <code>InputStream</code> or <code>OutputStream</code> provides a very nice way to decouple the encoding of information from the processing of it.  An interesting example in the Whiley compiler is that of <em>name mangling</em>.  That is, encoding the Whiley type of a function into its name.  To generate the mangling, I have an <code>OutputStream</code> implementation which takes a Whiley type and serialises it into binary data.  Then, a second implementation of <code>OutputStream</code> takes an arbitrary stream of binary data and encodes it into (roughly speaking) 7-bit ASCII &mdash; in other words, it turns the serialised data into a form that can safely be used as part of a method name according to the <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html>JVM Spec</a>.  And, of course, I have the mirror of this for reading the type out of a mangling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stateful encoders/decoders are important</strong>.  One idea we discussed was that encoding could be handled if: (1) Java had support for lambdas; and (2) classes like E.g. <code>FileReader</code> accepted a decoding (lambda) function.  This would cover a large number of use cases, and conceptually simplify the I/O framework.  However, we would need our decoding functions to have state to be useful (and I don&rsquo;t believe that <a href=http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/>JSR 335 supports this</a>).  State is necessary typically in situations where we can &mdash; <em>or want</em> &mdash; to read chunks larger than necessary.  For example, when performing some kind of buffering we read a large chunk and cache it for later.  Other examples of stateful stream components include unusual things, such as providing the ability to insert logging into the pipeline.</p></li></ul><p>At this point, things were all making sense to me.  Having worked with C for many years (albeit some time ago now), I&rsquo;m fairly familiar with how I/O is handled in C.  In particular, I/O mostly goes through the <code>FILE*</code> structure (although you can read/write to file descriptors directly if you like).  You have to rely on functions like <code>fopen()</code> and <code>popen()</code> to create <code>FILE*</code> instances because we don&rsquo;t know the internal layout of <code>FILE*</code> and, hence, cannot construct our own instances.  So, my first attack on this structure was to say something like:</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;How do you create a FILE</em> instance from a memory buffer?*&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>In Java, this is relatively easy since we can create e.g. a <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code> and pass that to anything accepting an <code>InputStream</code>. <em>Well, it turns out you can do this in C!</em> I had never heard of it before, but there is a <code>fmemopen()</code> function for exactly this use case.</p><p>Undeterred, I countered with:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;How do you create a FILE* instance which automagically encodes/decodes into a user-defined format (e.g. as per my name mangling example above)?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Again, this is relatively easy to do in Java by providing your own implementation of e.g. <code>InputStream </code>. At this point, there was a long pause (in fact, overnight) in the discussion.  The next day, my friend comes back and says: <em>&ldquo;ah, you obviously haven&rsquo;t heard of the <code>fopencookie()</code> function then!&rdquo;</em>. Nope, I hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p>This is an excerpt from the manpage on <code>fopencookie()</code>:</p><blockquote><p>The fopencookie() function allows the programmer to
create a custom implementation for a standard I/O stream.<br>This implementation can store the stream&rsquo;s data at a
location of its own choosing; for example, fopencookie() is
used to implement fmemopen(3), which provides a stream
interface to data that is stored in a buffer in memory.</p><p>In order to create a custom stream the programmer must:</p><ul><li><p>Implement four &ldquo;hook&rdquo; functions that are used internally
by the standard I/O library when performing I/O on the
stream.</p></li><li><p>Define a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; data type, a structure that provides
bookkeeping information (e.g., where to store data)
used by the aforementioned hook functions. The
standard I/O package knows nothing about the
contents of this cookie (thus it is typed as void * when
passed to fopencookie()), but automatically supplies
the cookie as the first argument when calling the hook
functions.</p></li><li><p>Call fopencookie() to open a new stream and associate
the cookie and hook functions with that stream.</p></li></ul><p>&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>Well, I guess you learn a new thing every day &mldr;</p><hr></div></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(function(e,t,n,s,o,i,a){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=o,e[o]=e[o]||function(){(e[o].q=e[o].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[o].l=1*new Date,i=t.createElement(n),a=t.getElementsByTagName(n)[0],i.async=1,i.src=s,a.parentNode.insertBefore(i,a)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-5582165-7","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script></body></html>
