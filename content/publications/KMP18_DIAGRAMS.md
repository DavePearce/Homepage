**Abstract:** Symmetry is often considered a desirable feature of dia-
grams. However, quantifying the exact amount of symmetry present is
often difficult. We propose a novel symmetry metric that can score the
amount of rotational, translational, and reflective symmetry present in
a graph or line diagram.
