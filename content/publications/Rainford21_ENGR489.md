**Abstract.** Whiley is an imperative and functional programming
language that supports Extended Static Checking through formal
verification. TypeScript is a gradually typed programming language
that is a superset of JavaScript. The main purpose of TypeScript is to
add type safety to the JavaScript language. This project designed and
implemented a Whiley compiler backend plugin for translating Whiley
into TypeScript that can then be compiled into JavaScript to be
executed in the browser. This plugin was evaluated using the existing
Whiley compiler test suite, the WyBench benchmark suite and on real
web applications such as Conway's Game of Life and Minesweeper.
