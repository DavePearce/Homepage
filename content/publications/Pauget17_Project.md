**Abstract.** Improving code performances lies more and more in the relevant use of computational helpers.
Computing platforms like OpenCL or CUDA that enable to relocate resource consuming calculations to
graphics processing unit (GPU) are now ordinary. Theses frameworks are rather low-level and require
either a thorough learning or the use of higher level libraries that reduce their flexibility. A orthogonal
concern of programming language is static checking. As the rise of strongly typed languages (Rust, Scala,
Haskell, ...) reveals it, extended static checking is well-liked since it improves greatly the development
process, lowering the debug work. The Whiley language goes a step further, by providing
an embedded support for specification, giving a chance to adjust the scope of compilation-time checks.
Targeting Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for Whiley compilation tries to gather these two
goals.
