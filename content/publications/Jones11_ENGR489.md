**Abstract.** Introducing concurrent behaviour into a program tends to also introduce unpredictable behaviour. The actor model is an attempt to simplify concurrency and reduce such problems. The Whiley programming language is structured around concurrent processes, which are analogous to actors, but it runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine, which does not provide support for the model. This project implemented the model for JVM in a manner specific to Whiley.
