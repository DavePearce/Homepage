**Abstract.** This document contains a full report on the Profiling Collections in Java project. The project focuses on the development of a tool that profiles the use of different implementations of the `Collection` interface in Java and allows us to analyse their use with regards to efficiency. It is our hypothesis that the efficiency, and therefore performance, of software may suffer as a result of poor decisions made by the developer when choosing which `Collection` implementations to use in their code. Our profiling tool will allow us to determine whether or not this is true.
