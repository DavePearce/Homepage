**Abstract.** Whiley2Cpp is a plugin for the Whiley programming
language that is being developed as part of this project. The plugin
translates Whiley code into C++ code. Whiley is a programming language
that uses an automated theorem prover to statically check programs
for correctness. C++ is an efficient and widely used programming
language that has limited tools to ensure the safety of the
code. Transpiling to C++ is not as straightforward as a word for word
translation. This is because of differences in the languages such as
the discrepancies between C++ types and Whiley types.
