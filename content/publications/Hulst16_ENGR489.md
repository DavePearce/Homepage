**Abstract.** This project is concerned with creating a software simulation and visualisation of a model railway to improve the efficiency of testing software controllers.  Testing a train controller on a physical railway is time consuming and limited by what is physically available to test on. A simulation and visualisation of the model track will reduce these issues by providing a quicker testing platform for the controllers. The simulation, visualisation and a track builder were successfully created in Java. A controller was developed on the simulation to control the trains and transferred over to the physical system. The controller was able to successfully control the trains.
