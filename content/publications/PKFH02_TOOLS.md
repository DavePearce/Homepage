**Abstract:**  This paper desribes a dynamic instrumentation tool for the Linux Kernal which allows a stock Linux kernel to be modified while in execution, with instruments implemented as kernel modules.  The Intel x86 architecture poses a particular problem, due to variable length instructions, which this paper addresses for the first time.  Finally we present a short case study illustrating its use in understanding i/o behaviour in the kernel.  The source code is freely available for download.
