**Abstract.** Executing Whiley in the web browser requires a server for processing. With many people using Whiley in the web browser simultaneously, this server can become very slow. JavaScript is programming language designed to execute in the web browser without a server. This project designed and implemented a translator for turning Whiley programs into JavaScript. Two web applications, Minesweeper and Conwayâ€™s Game of Life have been built in Whiley then executed in the browser using translated JavaScript and HTML5.
