**Abstract.** Ethereum is a blockchain based platform that supports a Turing complete contract language. However, methods of writing smart contracts have been error prone. This has resulted in many historically expensive bugs such as the DAO.  Whiley is a programming language which allows you to verify code. This project looks at compiling Whiley to Ethereum bytecode in order to utilise Whiley's verification tools to make writing smart contracts safer. Finally, we run some coverage tests to see how the developed method adheres to the Whiley language.
