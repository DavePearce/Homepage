**Abstract:** An ongoing challenge for computer science is the development of a tool which automatically verifies programs meet their specifications, and are free from runtime errors such as divide-by-zero, array out-of-bounds and null dereferences. Several impressive systems have been developed to this end, such as ESC/Java and Spec#, which build on existing programming languages (e.g. Java, C#). However, there remains a need for an open research platform in this area. We have developed the Whiley programming language, and its accompanying verifying compiler, as an open platform for research. Whiley has been designed from the ground up to simplify the verification process. In this paper, we introduce the Whiley language and it accompanying verifying compiler tool.
