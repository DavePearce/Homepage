The following updates have been made:

   * Incorporated the vorder push heuristic suggested by Michael
     Monagan.  As part of this, I've added the ability to sort the
     vertex order according to a depth-first or breadth-first search.
     Again, this was suggested by Michael and it really makes a big
     difference for computing Truncated Icosahedron (and probably lots
     of other graphs). I've got to do some more experimentation!
