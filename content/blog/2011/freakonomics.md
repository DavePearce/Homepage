Recently, I finished reading [Freakonomics, by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner](http://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/006073132X). and I have to say that I really liked it!!

The book is focuses on the study of everyday aspects of life using the tools of economics and statistics.  What I really liked is that the author is really trying to uncover the truth, and expose those who proliferate propaganda.  Anyway, there's also an accompanying [website](http://freakonomicsbook.com/) which hosts a great blog covering a variety of interesting topics.
