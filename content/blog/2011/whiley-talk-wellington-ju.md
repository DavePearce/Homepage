Last month, the Wellington Java User Group was kind enough to invite me to give a talk on Whiley.  The talk is a general introduction to Whiley, including the syntax, some issues related to implementation and inter-operation with Java.  The talk was video and, finally, after some faffing around I've uploaded it onto YouTube here:

Anyway, enjoy!

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to Evan for suggesting upload the slides as well --- <a href="http://whiley.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/JUG2011-Whiley.pdf">you can get them here</a>!
