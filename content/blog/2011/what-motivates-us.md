Here's an interesting video  that I just came across (adapted from [Dan Pink's](http://www.danpink.com/) talk at [the RSA](http://www.thersa.org/), which is currently doing the rounds:

The video is about what motivates people to do things and, in particular, whether or not giving people more money means they do a better job.Â  Definitely worth a look ... and I might even get [the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594488843?ie=UTF8&tag=freeagentnati-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594488843)!

**UPDATE:** there's a [TED talk on this subject](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y&feature=player_detailpage) as well ...
