Recently, I was on [VBC 88.3FM](http://vbc.org.nz/) (Victoria University's Student Radio) giving a 60s "speed summary" of my research, and generally chatting about some tech stuff.  The station has been interviewing a whole range of people at the university to raise awareness of what research is going on.  Anyhow, I agreed to do the interview which was fun --- and [here's the MP3.](/files/2012/VBC-60s-interview-2012.mp3)

Anyway, the interview is pretty short and doesn't cover a lot of detail.  But, it was kind of fun being on the radio! I think the question about what food I'd eat if I could eat anything was the hardest ... and I should have known better than to say "Linux Operating System".  Still, it was good to practice my "pitch" ...
