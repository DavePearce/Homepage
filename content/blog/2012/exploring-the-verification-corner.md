title: "Exploring The Verification Corner"

Recently, I was lucky enough to meet [Rustan Leino](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/) whilst at a conference in Tallin, Estonia.  The Whiley project owes a lot to Rustan, as much of his work has been the inspiration behind Whiley.  In particular, his [PhD thesis](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/papers/Caltech-CS-TR-95-03.pdf) introduced the idea of [Extended Static Checking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_static_checking) and he then worked on the seminal ESC/Modula project,  which in turn became {{<wikip page="ESC/Java">}}ESC/Java{{</wikip>}} --- the tool that widely popularised the idea.  He then worked on Spec# and is now working on [Dafny](https://dafny.org).  All of these are programming systems which use compile-time verification of constraints (e.g. pre- and post-conditions), and have really set the standard for this field.

Anyhow, Rustan is a really interesting guy and we had a good chat about Whiley.  But, that's not what I wanted to talk about here.  Rustan pointed me to his [Verification Corner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/the-verification-corner/), which contains lots of interesting videos about verifying programs.  I've pulled out just a couple here that I liked, but there are otheres there ... so go have a look around yourself!
