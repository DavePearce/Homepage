title: "Exploring The Verification Corner"

Recently, I was lucky enough to meet <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/">Rustan Leino</a> whilst at a conference in Tallin, Estonia.  The Whiley project owes a lot to Rustan, as much of his work has been the inspiration behind Whiley.  In particular, his <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/papers/Caltech-CS-TR-95-03.pdf">PhD thesis</a> introduced the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_static_checking">Extended Static Checking</a> and he then worked on the seminal ESC/Modula project,  which in turn became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC/Java">ESC/Java</a> --- the tool that widely popularised the idea.  He then worked on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spec_Sharp">Spec#</a> and is now working on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dafny/">Dafny</a>.  All of these are programming systems which use compile-time verification of constraints (e.g. pre- and post-conditions), and have really set the standard for this field.

Anyhow, Rustan is a really interesting guy and we had a good chat about Whiley.  But, that's not what I wanted to talk about here.  Rustan pointed me to his <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/mobile/showpage.aspx?page=/en-us/projects/verificationcorner">"Verification Corner"</a>, which contains lots of interesting videos about verifying programs.  I've pulled out just a couple here that I liked, but there are otheres there ... so go have a look around yourself!
