I've recently finished Paul Allen's excellent memoir entitled ["Idea Man"](http://www.paulallen.com/) and the recent biography of Steve Jobs by [Walter Isaacson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson).  Obviously, I didn't read them at the same time ... but one after there other!  But, they were a fascinating read taken together, as they cover some of the same story from different angles.  I particularly enjoyed Paul Allen's hacking stories from when he was a young budding programmer ... they reminded me of good times!  And, understanding Steve Jobs has helped me understand Apple and what it stands for a lot more.  I'm still undecided whether I think open or closed platforms are the way forward, but obviously Apple has managed some pretty impressive stuff recently ... so I guess we'll see!
