Recently, I gave a demo of Whiley at [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/labs/labs/intro) in Brisbane which they have kindly put up on YouTube:

The actual demo itself starts around 11:30s, so you might want to skip on to that.  

The talk was part of a series of talks I did at various locations across the globe, including Google @ Mountain View + London, Microsoft Research @ Cambridge, [Cambridge University](http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/72580), [Oxford University](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/seminars/1858.html), Imperial College, University of Sydney, Macquarie University, Data61, and more.  It's sure been busy, but I had a great time!!
