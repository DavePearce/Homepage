Recently, I gave a demo of Whiley at <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:23:::::P23_LOCATION_ID:46">Oracle Labs in Brisbane</a> which they have kindly put up on YouTube:

The actual demo itself starts around <a href="https://youtu.be/dGsD_K-IAgA?t=11m30s">11:30s</a>, so you might want to skip on to that.  

The talk was part of a series of talks I did at various locations across the globe, including Google @ Mountain View + London, Microsoft Research @ Cambridge, <a href="http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/72580">Cambridge University</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/seminars/1858.html">Oxford University</a>, <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/engineering/computing/eventssummary/event_9-5-2017-9-54-5?platform=hootsuite">Imperial College</a>, <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/research/news/david-pearce.shtml">University of Sydney</a>, Macquarie University, Data61, and more.  It's sure been busy, but I had a great time!!
