The [web IDE for Whiley](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyWeb) is the easiest way to run Whiley, and it's even better after a little face lift!  Here's the obligatory screenshot:

You can run this on your local machine by cloning the [Github repo](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyWeb) and running `ant run` from the command-line.  For now, you can also try it out in the browser at [whileylabs.com](http://whileylabs.com).

The Web IDE allows you to verify Whiley programs and compile them to JavaScript.  In principle, you can run them in the browser ... though it needs a little more work yet.
