Today's edition of the [Dominion Post](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/) (Wellington's Local Newspaper) features a nice article on Whiley:

Obviously, I'm very excited to see Whiley being talked about in our local newspaper, and I think the article does a nice job of it.Â  There is also an [electronic version as well](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8160382/System-aims-to-stop-software-glitches).
