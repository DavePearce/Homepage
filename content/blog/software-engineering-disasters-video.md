So, recently I came across a good video which looks at a number of interesting software failures.  The video looks at the [Ariane 5 Flight 501](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5_Flight_501"), the <a title="Patriot Missle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot">Patriot missle clock glitch</a>, and more.
