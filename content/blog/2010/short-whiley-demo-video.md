I've put together a little demonstration of the Whiley language in use.  The demo only covers the basic idea of Whiley and, in particular, demonstrates how the pre- and post-conditions work:

Anyway, this was a bit of fun for a Saturday afternoon.  Turns out making videos is harder than I thought ;)
