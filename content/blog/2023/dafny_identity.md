Recently, I came across [a tweet](https://twitter.com/Mathinity_/status/1679451151517859841?s=20)
about the following identity:

This seemed quite surprising to me, though the tweet's thread included
a number of proofs.  We can check the first few values easily for
ourself:

So, the thought occurred: _can we prove this identity with Dafny?_

## Setup

## Proof
