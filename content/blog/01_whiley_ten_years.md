title: "Whiley is Ten Years Old!"
draft: true
---

The [first commit](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler/commit/0529dcf296877b89f0ddca2c942daff4a5e72429) recorded in the [WhileyCompiler](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler) repository on Github is dated June 25th, 2010.  *That means Whiley has been going for just over ten years already!*  Wow, time sure does fly.  It's not a very interesting first commit though.  And, looking closely, you can see that commit is actually from the subversion repository that Whiley was originally hosted in.  The first real commit to the GitHub repository is dated [November 22, 2010](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler/commit/63cb03b19b357757660b15058919c29f08fba3e5).  Again, it's not a very interesting commit!  Since those early commits, a lot has happened --- including around 7.6K more commits.  The first post on [whiley.org](http://whiley.org) is date [June 7th 2010](http://whiley.org/2010/06/07/software-engineering-disasters-video/), with the first talking about Whiley comming [on the same day](http://whiley.org/2010/06/07/wjc-status-update/).

Anyway, I'm not going to bore you with a full break down of everything that's happened!  Instead, here are a few highlights for me right now:
