title: "Functional Reactive Programming in Whiley"
description: "Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a paradigm which brings functional programming to inherently non-functional environments.  FRP has been recently popularised for building web applications through the likes of React, Angular, Elm, etc.  In this talk, I'll explore FRP for building web applications and, in particular, examine an FRP framework written in Whiley and how it works."
