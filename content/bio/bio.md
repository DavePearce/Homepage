Having moved from Imperial College London to Victoria University
 (Wellington, NZ) in 2004, I'm now enjoying life in New Zealand! At
 Imperial College, I was a PhD student in the department of
 Computing. My thesis topic was on pointer analysis, although this
 lead me in some interesting and alternative directions. Pointer
 analysis is the problem of determining what the pointer variables in
 a program may point to without running it. Thus, it is a form of
 static analysis and an increasingly important component of compilers
 and program understanding tools.

My current research interests focus around the issues of improving
software quality. In particular, using advanced compiler technologies
to automatically find errors in programs. Finally, my other interests
include: programming language design, Tutte polynomials and graph
algorithms.
