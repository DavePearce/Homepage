Find out more at whiley.org or try it online at whileylabs.com. The complete source code for the compiler and theorem prover is available on GitHub.</description></item><item><title>The Java Compiler Kit</title><link>https://whileydave.com/projects/jkit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/projects/jkit/</guid><description>The Java Compiler Kit is a straightforward implementation of a Java compiler, designed with extensibility in mind. In building the JKit compiler, the aims were: firstly, to help with teaching compilers by considering an implementation for a fully fledged language (Java), rather than a stripped-down imitation language; secondly, to aid research in programming languages, compilers and verification.</description></item><item><title>Tutte Polynomials</title><link>https://whileydave.com/projects/tutte/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/projects/tutte/</guid><description>Overview. Tutte polynomials play an important role in graph theory, combinatorics, matroid theory, knot theory, and experimental physics. For example, the polynomials can be evaluated to find the number of spanning trees in a graph, the number of forests in a graph, the number of connected spanning subgraphs, the number of spanning subgraphs, and the number of acyclic orientations.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Topological Sort</title><link>https://whileydave.com/projects/dts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/projects/dts/</guid><description>The problem of topologically sorting a directed graph is about arranging its nodes so that all edges go in the same direction. For example, consider the following directed graph:
A topological sort of this graph is:</description></item><item><title>DJProf</title><link>https://whileydave.com/projects/djprof/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/projects/djprof/</guid><description>DJProf is an experimental Java profiling tool which employs AspectJ to insert the necessary instrumentation for profiling rather than, for example, the Java Machine Profiler Interface (JVMPI). DJProf can be used to profile Java programs without modification (i.</description></item><item><title>GILK</title><link>https://whileydave.com/projects/gilk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whileydave.com/projects/gilk/</guid><description>The GILK project was part of my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Imperial College London. The project is all about dynamic instrumentation of the Linux Kernel. This means that a stock (i.e. without any source code modification) kernel can be instrumented whilst in execution!</description></item></channel></rss>
